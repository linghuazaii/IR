MARIA SHARAPOVA FAILED DRUG TEST AT AUSTRALIAN OPEN

Maria Sharapova, the Russian tennis star, has failed her drug test at the Australian Open. Sharapova was taking meldonium, a drug that increases blood flow. The drug is also known as mildronate. She had been legally taking the drug for 10 years and claims she did not know that the drug was on the list of substances athletes cannot take. The drug was only added to the list this year.

During a press conference, Sharapova revealed that she doesnâ€™t know what the consequences will be yet, but expressed that she would not like to end her career this way.
