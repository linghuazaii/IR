10-YEAR OLD GIRL BORN IN CHINA WANTS TO RUN FOR U.S. PRESIDENT

Alena Mulhern, a 10-year old girl adopted from China who now lives in Kingston, Massachusetts, wants U.S. laws to change so that she can run for the office of President of the United States. Right now, only those who are born in the United States can run for this office.
Alena spoke to members of the Massachusetts State House, and shared her feeling that everyone should have a chance to be U.S. President. She tried to convince House members to ask the U.S. Congress to change the U.S. Constitution, making it possible for children adopted from other countries to be able to run for office. Alena thinks the law is very old, and that all good people should be allowed the chance to become U.S. President.

Having moved to the U.S. at just 10 months old, Alena says she is just as American as others born in the United States. Alena has set a goal to change U.S. law, and will not let anyone tell her that being President is something she canâ€™t do.
