CLOSE 2015 PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN ARGENTINA

Argentina held its presidential election this past Sunday.  Mauricio Macri shocked supporters of the popular candidate, Daniel Scioli, by coming in with a very close margin of the vote to warrant a tie-breaker election.  Scioli did not receive 45 percent of the votes in order to win. As a result, a tie-breaker election will take place on November 22, 2015.  

Supported by residing president, Cristina Fernandez, Scioli is now reaching out to voters who have no commitment to either candidate.  He will likely try to convince voters that Macri’s policies will cause an economic crisis resulting in poverty.  However, after Sunday’s unexpected election results, some Scioli supporters are unsure as to whether or not he will be able to make a comeback.  

Already mayor in Buenos Aires, Macri has a good chance of becoming the next president.  His support has already helped a candidate win the election for Buenos Aires’ governor.  Buenos Aires is the most populated province in Argentina.
